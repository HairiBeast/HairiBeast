## Hi, I'm Harri ðŸ‘‹
### My current portfolio can be viewed at www.harribestdesign.uk
Currently transitioning into the tech industry after a fulfilling decade of teaching. 
I have always had an interest in tech, such as building my own computer and tinkering with software and hardware. Now, School of Code has given me the opportunity I felt I had missed earlier in my life. 
I bring a wealth of transferable skills which have been invaluable when working within Agile team. I enjoy the process of creating intuitive UI/UX and applying front-end and back-end skills.
Testing has also been a particular interest of mine, from unit testing to integration and E2E tests (using Jest/Vitest and Cypress).
